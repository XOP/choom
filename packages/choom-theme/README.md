# CHOOM THEME

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/choom-theme)

Core dependency for the Choom UI kits.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add choom-theme
```

## Setup

Essentially styling is based on CSS variables (custom properties).  
To ensure the core styling layer include `index.css` in your project:

```js
import "choom-theme/dist/index.css";
```

To make use of the CSS-in-JS variables explore `index.js`, it contains all same variables.
